Hello reader!

This doc is quick rundown on sources plus some general dev notes.


Disclaimer:

All of the Kaiserreich Mod belongs to the Kaiserreich team and their members.
This is just a Submod that interacts with and sometimes reuses code and/or gfx.
This mod is subject to the Kaiserreich Usage Policy, found at:
https://kaiserreich.fandom.com/wiki/Usage_Policy

General notes:

This is the framework, or better, dependency of the reworked mod.

This, on its own, does nothing visible ingame, instead it is used to define things such
as decision categories which all modules of the mod should be able to use.
Thus, everything else depends on this.

Dev notes:

As with the previous iteration of this mod, this still has a long way to go.
